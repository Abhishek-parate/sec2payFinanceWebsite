          Sec2Pay is committed to appreciating and respecting the choice and privacy of its user base and the business associates when they use our website and services. The statement here highlights and gives information about the privacy practices employed and used by us in relation to the personal information we hold of our business associates and users.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Definition and Description</strong>
          <br>
          For the purposes of the privacy policy, personal information and data include the data and information that can be identified or linked to specific users. This information may include address, name, mailing address, email id, telephone number, debit/credit card details, name of the cardholder, expiration, date of the card, mobile phone number related information, data card, DTH service information, electricity connection data and any other data, information, and details that are provided by the users and associates voluntarily while availing the services of the website of Sec2Pay.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Exception to Sec2Pay Privacy Policy:</strong>
          <br>
          Data and information provided by the users/business associates in the public forums and environments, live chat room, blog, album, social networking sites, discussion boards, classifieds, community and the likes (without limitation), are not deemed to be confidential and hence are not considered as personal/sensitive information and data, according to Sec2Pay privacy policy. Such information is therefore not protected under our privacy policy.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Use of Personal Information and Data</strong>
          <br>
          Sec2Pay uses the personal data and information given by the users/business associates to provide them and with specific services that have been explicitly requested by a user/associate. The personal information is required and used by Sec2Pay to troubleshoot concerns, resolve disputes, collect money, promote safe and secure services, inform the users and associates about our services/offers/updates, assess the interest of users and associates in our services, and prevent us in committing errors. The information may also be used for preventing criminal activity and fraud, and for enforcing terms and conditions, among other uses.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Disclosure of Information Data</strong>
          <br>
          Sec2Pay shares sensitive or private confidential data or information with an external organization only when it is necessary to enable us to provide the services to business associates and users. We may also share the information when it is necessary for us to do so for completing a legitimate transaction, for reporting purposes (required or necessary under the terms and conditions applicable to the information), and/or because of the applicability of the law. In no other scenario shall we share the confidential and personal data and information of our users and business associates. The information of the business associates and users will be shared when it is required or permitted by law.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Observation and Implementation of Reasonable Security Practices</strong>
          <br>
          Sec2Pay undertakes the necessary and reasonable precautions for maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of data and information of our users as well as business associates. For the purpose, we provide restricted access to persons who may be required to assess the data and information (on a need to know basis). We also provide the necessary training to our employees for ensuring safe and proper handling of data.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Links to Other Websites</strong>
          <br>
          The Sec2Pay website also has links to other websites. Users should know and understand that when they click on any of the links, they enter into another website. We assume no responsibility for these websites. We encourage the users to read and understand the privacy statements of these websites, which may be different from the privacy policy of Sec2Pay. The users/associates are solely responsible for ensuring the security and secrecy of their membership accounts, and their passwords.
          
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-black">Privacy Policy Updates</strong>
          <br>
          Sec2Pay has the full rights to make changes to the data privacy practices it uses/employs, and to update the privacy statement whenever a need arises. The same updates and changes will be made available on our website.
